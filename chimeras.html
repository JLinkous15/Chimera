                <p>The Chimera, according to Greek Mythology, was a monstrous, 
                fire-breathing creature composed of different animal parts from Lycia.
                It is usually depicted as being a lion is a goat's headprotruding 
                from its back with the tail of a snake. As the offspring of Typhon 
                and Echidna, it is a sibling to monsters such as Cerberus and Hydra. 
                The term "chimera" has come to describe any mythical or fictional creature 
                with parts taken from various animals to describe anything composed of 
                very disparate parts.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>According to Homer, the original Chimera was slayed by Bellerophon at the order 
                of the king of Lycia. To slay the beast, Bellerophon worked with Pegasus--
                another type of chimera-- and shot arrows at the Lycian Chimera from above. Will 
                you take on the role of Typhon and Echidna and create a horde of mostrous 
                agents to terrorize the land? Or will you become the heroic Bellerophon and 
                protect the people from these beasts and their elemental exhalations with your own 
                chimera partner? Click below to get started!
